  <h2 class="heading--no-overline">Why use a warning announcement?</h2>
  <p>Using a warning announcement for non-life-threatening circumstances can be crucial in maintaining public awareness and preparedness. By issuing such warnings, authorities can effectively disseminate important information that helps individuals make informed decisions and take necessary precautions to mitigate risks. Examples of warnings include severe weather events or ongoing public health concerns. Ultimately, while the event may not be life-threatening, the potential for disruption and inconvenience underscores the importance of timely and clear warnings.</p>
